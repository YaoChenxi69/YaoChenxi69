1        Once upon a time in a Primordial land, where Rivers of magic flow across the world,
      where Primordials ruled, made beings Out of stone, The Primordials were the first to reign. 
        then one fateful day, one fateful night, the Primordials, declared war on God, 
         on the twelve day they were erased they were erased without Anyone left.
6000 years back tensions were high. seen by the people, seen by their fear, the Anukans the           Celesarians.
                    Celesarians won and Anukans lost. The Anukans challenged Celesarians to space.
Once a paradise of the light as war swept through, unbound, the people lost their life one came out              of dark standing on the podium, speaking his malignant thoughts, tricking the broken light into a corrupted path.
        once upon a time in a primordial land where Primordials lived and Primordials died. There were two races competed to Space.
                                          Now the new chapter of the world is now in its hands.
